- **Labor Rates (Tabs 1a, 1b, 1c, 2, 3, 4 (reference)):** 
  - For suppliers with an existing CGA agreement, this section is not applicable. Previously agreed rates will be applicable.
  - The cost components in the MARCUS Commercial Proposal Template will be extrapolated into a final, fully burdened bill rate, which will be introduced as Exhibit B in the updated CGA [MARCUS] Construction Template for U.S. Projects upon agreement with Google. 
  - Through mutual agreement, the labor rates will be established for a  three-year period, using the {{{currentYear}}} base rate as a foundation and applying a calculated percentage escalation for years two and three.
  - All labor rates must be submitted in US dollars. Currency conversions are for reference purposes only and should not be considered for pricing. Please note, if you already have an executed CGA on file with agreed upon rates, the entered rates should match the previously agreed upon rates for the next three years.

Sites with active construction projects have in person coverage while the work is being performed. Mileage between sites may be submitted as an expense and will be reimbursed only upon approval from the Google program approver.
